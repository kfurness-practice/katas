# War

## What I liked
* When I first started, I felt like I had NO IDEA what I was doing (which I didn't), but it was nice to feel like I was being productive and trying, even if I was going at it wrong.

## What was hard
* Deciding how to even start the game was really difficult. For example, I had no one saying, you will get an array of the player's turns that represent the game. I didn't know what information I would be getting because I had to come up with it on my own.
* In relation to above, I didn't know what my first test should be because I did not even know how to organize the initial information. Is the first thing I do dividing the cards equally amongst players? Is it just deciding who wins a simple example?

## Steps I took
1. Created a function to see who won a single round of war.
2. Work on creating a deck of cards
