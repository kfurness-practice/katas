# Hamming

## What I liked
* Taking small steps to solve the problem really helped me focus on what I wanted my function to do.
* The tests helped me be confident that my function will work
* It allowed me to refactor my code in a more efficient manner
* When I did refactor, I knew I was not going to mess things up, because I worked in small chunks

## What was hard
* I think the hardest part off TDD is deciding what tests to create. This Kata had the tests already determined, which was helpful; however, if I did not have test cases to follow, I feel like this would have been so much more difficult all around.
* In relation to the comment above, the provided test cases helped me know how I wanted my function to look, but left without test cases, it would have been more difficult for me to come up with that.
